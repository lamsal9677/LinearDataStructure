 My flow:
	1. Get the data from the file
		* Length will be length of whole file / 6
		a. Make a new method apart from main method that only reads
		b. Make a new method that only writes(filename , fileContent)
	2. Group the data in 6 variable each ---- with linked with an object
		a. Make an array of each
		b. loop every six and get all the names......
	3. Get a new array for zips
	4. Radix sort the zips
	5. Get the values back
	6. Export to the file 
	
	
	READ PUT INTO ARRAY AND o/p THE ARRAY
	DO RADIX SORT AT THE END OR MAKE AN IDEA ABOUT IT
*/
	

/*
	
Make all the item an array with a new line each
0-5 is 1 6-11 is another and so on
check by just getting the names, just getting the address
have all the arrays into objects of each person


for (i=0; i<last; ;i=i+6) {
	String name = address[i];
	String Addressline1 = address[i+1];
	String AddressLine2 = address[i+2];
	String City = address[i+3];
	String State = address[i+4];
	String Zip = address[i+5];
	
	I can send all these to a constructor or something and make an array of oject to store all of these
